# Cyware CSAP Transition

Beginning March 1, 2025, TAMUS Cybersecurity is transitioning away from Cyware's CSAP platform to several purpose-built applications to better integrate with existing business processes and realize cost savings.

* Incident notification reporting is now delivered via [Jira Service Management](/policy/guidelines/incident-notification/)
* Outbound customer communications and threat intelligence bulletins are now delivered via [GovDelivery](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/TXAMUSCS/subscriber/new/)
* Inbound customer communications may use the methods published on our [Contact page](/contact/)
* Technical threat intelligence (including TIP feeds) are available by [contacting TAMUS Cyber Operations](/contact/)
* Required reporting document sharing with the TAMUS Office of System CISO is now delivered via [OneTrust GRC](https://tamus.my.onetrust.com)

Historical data will be retained in Cyware until early 2026. If access is required after March 1, email contact@cyber.tamus.edu to request access.
