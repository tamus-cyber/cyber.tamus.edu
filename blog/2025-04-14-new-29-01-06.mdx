System Regulation 29.01.06 was released last week, which implements what was previously a policy letter from the System CIO to all members addressing covered applications and prohibited technology.

The guidelines page at https://cyber.tamus.edu/policy/guidelines/prohibited-technology/ has been updated to reflect these changes.  The regulation is also available at https://policies.tamus.edu/29-01-06.pdf.
