As part of our implementation of security control standard RA-5(11), _Public Disclosure Program_, today we implemented a consolidated public reporting system for vulnerabilities of Texas A&M system information resources. Information regarding the program and the vulnerability reporting form is available at https://cyber.tamus.edu/vuln-report/.

We have also released the first version of a TAMUS standardized `security.txt`, a file format to aid in security vulnerability disclosure specified by RFC 9116. This file is published at https://cyber.tamus.edu/.well-known/security.txt and is also available for members to use on their respective institution websites.
