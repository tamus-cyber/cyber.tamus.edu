The comment period for new security control standards regarding Identity Proofing ([IA-12(2)](/catalog/ia/ia-12/#ia-12.02)) and Identity Evidence Validation and Verification ([IA-12(3)](/catalog/ia/ia-12/#ia-12.03)) has closed and the new standards have been published in the A&M System Security Control Standards Catalog.

**Because this is a time-sensitive procedural implementation to address actively-exploited cyber risks, the implementation date is effective September 1.**

When developing your member-level procedures to implement this control standard, please also take into consideration distributed systems with user accounts for which organizations other than IT may be responsible (this includes HR for TAMUS SSO accounts, Provost/Enrollment Management/Alumni Affairs for prospective students, alumni, etc.) and ensure those administrators are properly briefed on the control requirement.
