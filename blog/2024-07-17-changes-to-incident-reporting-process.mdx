We have made slight modifications to the incident reporting process within the TAMUS ISAO Portal.  Please see the updated instructions here: https://cyber.tamus.edu/policy/guidelines/incident-notification/submit-incident/

These changes simplify the steps necessary for members to submit incident reports, eliminates extraneous actions on the back-end for TAMUS Cyber, and allows for TAMUS Cyber to communicate back-and-forth with the reporting member directly within the TAMUS ISAO Portal.
