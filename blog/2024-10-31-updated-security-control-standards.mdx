We released today a series of administrative changes to the security control standards. The majority of these changes moved _TAMUS Implementation Statement_ language into organizationally-defined parameters (ODP) within each control, as well as implementing control standards that reflect existing system policy and assigning an impact baseline for all TAMUS-required controls.
