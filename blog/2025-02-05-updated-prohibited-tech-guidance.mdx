On January 31, 2025, DIR released an update to the prohibited technologies list to include the following software, applications, and developers:

* RedNote *
* Lemon8 *
* DeepSeek **
* Webull
* Tiger Brokers
* Moomoo
<!-- truncate -->

TAMUS Cyber Operations will begin blocking the domains associated with these vendors via our Cisco Umbrella DNS security service; however, members are encouraged to implement similar controls that you already have in place for other prohibited technologies to these vendors, including application blocking on managed devices and addition of firewall rules, where appropriate.

\* Note that the software, applications, and developers indicated with a * above are covered social media applications under Chapter 620 of the Texas Government Code and have limited criteria for exceptions. Refer to https://cyber.tamus.edu/policy/guidelines/prohibited-technology/ for additional details.

** DIR has not clarified whether the DeepSeek prohibition includes the open-source DeepSeek LLM. As the prohibited technologies list applies to software, applications, and developers, "DeepSeek" in this instance is presumed to include the entity and all of their products. As such and until further notice, members must take appropriate actions to (1) prevent users from utilizing the DeepSeek application, website, and open-source LLM on system-owned resources, and (2) prohibit users from utilizing the DeepSeek application, website, and open-source LLM on personal devices when conducting state business. The existing exception process for prohibited technology outlined at https://cyber.tamus.edu/policy/guidelines/prohibited-technology/ applies.
