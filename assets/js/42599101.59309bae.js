The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency insider threat posture."]})]})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>o});var r=n(96540);const i={},a=r.createContext(i);function s(e){const t=r.useContext(a);return r.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),r.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
