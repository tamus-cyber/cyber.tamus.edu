User responses that occur via trusted paths are protected from modification by and disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted paths for trustworthy, high-assurance connections between security functions of systems and users, including during system logons. The original implementations of trusted paths employed an out-of-band signal to initiate the path, such as using the BREAK key, which does not transmit characters that can be spoofed. In later implementations, a key combination that could not be hijacked was used (e.g., the CTRL-ALT-DEL keys). Such key combinations, however, are platform-specific and may not provide a trusted path implementation in every case.
