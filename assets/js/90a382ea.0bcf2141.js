A password manager is a solution to this problem as it automatically generates and stores strong and different passwords for various accounts. A potential risk of using password managers is that adversaries can target the collection of passwords generated by the password manager. Therefore, the collection of passwords requires protection including encrypting the passwords (see ",(0,i.jsx)("a",{xmlns:"http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0",href:"#ia-5.1_smt.d",children:"IA-5(1)(d)"})," ) and storing the collection offline in a token."]})]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>o});var i=n(96540);const s={},a=i.createContext(s);function r(e){const t=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
