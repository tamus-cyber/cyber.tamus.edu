Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet requirements established for protecting information and systems. Controls to protect media during transport include cryptography and locked containers. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated with media transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking and/or obtaining records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport of system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. Organizations maintain the flexibility to define record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part of a system of transport-related records."})]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(e.h2,{id:"mp-05.01",children:"MP-5(1) Protection Outside of Controlled Areas"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)("prop",{xmlns:"http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0",name:"status",value:"withdrawn",children:(0,i.jsxs)("em",{children:["[Withdrawn: Incorporated into ",(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{href:"../mp/mp-05#mp-05",children:"MP-5"}),".]"]})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(e.h2,{id:"mp-05.02",children:"MP-5(2) Documentation of Activities"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)("prop",{xmlns:"http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0",name:"status",value:"withdrawn",children:(0,i.jsxs)("em",{children:["[Withdrawn: Incorporated into ",(0,i.jsx)(e.a,{href:"../mp/mp-05#mp-05",children:"MP-5"}),".]"]})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(e.h2,{id:"mp-05.03",children:"MP-5(3) Custodians"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(e.h3,{id:"control-1",children:"Control"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:"Employ an identified custodian during transport of system media outside of controlled areas."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n,{children:[(0,i.jsx)("summary",{children:"Supplemental Guidance"}),(0,i.jsx)(e.p,{children:"Identified custodians provide organizations with specific points of contact during the media transport process and facilitate individual accountability.
