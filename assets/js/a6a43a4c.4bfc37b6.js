Correlating system monitoring tools and mechanisms that typically work in isolation\u2014including malicious code protection software, host monitoring, and network monitoring\u2014can provide an organization-wide monitoring view and may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of diverse monitoring tools and mechanisms and how to maximize the use of information generated by those tools and mechanisms can help organizations develop, operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. The correlation of monitoring information is especially important during the transition from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols)."})]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"si-04.17",children:"SI-4(17) Integrated Situational Awareness"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"control-15",children:"Control"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Correlate information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness."}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(i,{children:[(0,t.jsx)("summary",{children:"Supplemental Guidance"}),(0,t.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Correlating monitoring information from a more diverse set of information sources helps to achieve integrated situational awareness.
