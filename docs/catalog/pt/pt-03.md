  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Identifying and documenting the purpose for processing provides organizations with a basis for understanding why personally identifiable information may be processed. The term <q xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0">process</q> includes every step of the information life cycle, including creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal. Identifying and documenting the purpose of processing is a prerequisite to enabling owners and operators of the system and individuals whose information is processed by the system to understand how the information will be processed. This enables individuals to make informed decisions about their engagement with information systems and organizations and to manage their privacy interests. Once the specific processing purpose has been identified, the purpose is described in the organization&#8217;s privacy notices, policies, and any related privacy compliance documentation, including privacy impact assessments, system of records notices, <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> statements, computer matching notices, and other applicable Federal Register notices.
