  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

The <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> requires that federal agencies publish a system of records notice in the Federal Register upon the establishment and/or modification of a <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> system of records. As a general matter, a system of records notice is required when an agency maintains a group of any records under the control of the agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier. The notice describes the existence and character of the system and identifies the system of records, the purpose(s) of the system, the authority for maintenance of the records, the categories of records maintained in the system, the categories of individuals about whom records are maintained, the routine uses to which the records are subject, and additional details about the system as described in <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#3671ff20-c17c-44d6-8a88-7de203fa74aa">OMB A-108</a>.

A <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> routine use is a particular kind of disclosure of a record outside of the federal agency maintaining the system of records. A routine use is an exception to the <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> prohibition on the disclosure of a record in a system of records without the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. To qualify as a routine use, the disclosure must be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which the information was originally collected. The <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> requires agencies to describe each routine use of the records maintained in the system of records, including the categories of users of the records and the purpose of the use. Agencies may only establish routine uses by explicitly publishing them in the relevant system of records notice.
