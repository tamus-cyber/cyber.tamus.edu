# SC-6 Resource Availability {#sc-06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Protect the availability of resources by allocating <strong> <em>[Assignment: resources]</em> </strong> by <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): priority; quota; <strong> <em>[Assignment: controls]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Priority protection prevents lower-priority processes from delaying or interfering with the system that services higher-priority processes. Quotas prevent users or processes from obtaining more than predetermined amounts of resources.
