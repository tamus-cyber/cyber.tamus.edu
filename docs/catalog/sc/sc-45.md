## SC-45(1) Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source {#sc-45.01}

### Control

(a) Compare the internal system clocks _**[Assignment: frequency]**_ with _**[Assignment: authoritative time source]**_ ; and

(b) Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than _**[Assignment: time period]**_.

## SC-45(2) Secondary Authoritative Time Source {#sc-45.02}

### Control

(a) Identify a secondary authoritative time source that is in a different geographic region than the primary authoritative time source; and

(b) Synchronize the internal system clocks to the secondary authoritative time source if the primary authoritative time source is unavailable.
