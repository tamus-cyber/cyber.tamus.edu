# SC-32 System Partitioning {#sc-32}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Partition the system into <strong> <em>[Assignment: system components]</em> </strong> residing in separate <strong> <em>[Selection: physical; logical]</em> </strong> domains or environments based on <strong> <em>[Assignment: circumstances for the physical or logical separation of components]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

System partitioning is part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy. Organizations determine the degree of physical separation of system components. Physical separation options include physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, critical components in separate rooms, and geographical separation of critical components. Security categorization can guide the selection of candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned system components.

## SC-32(1) Separate Physical Domains for Privileged Functions {#sc-32.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Partition privileged functions into separate physical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Privileged functions that operate in a single physical domain may represent a single point of failure if that domain becomes compromised or experiences a denial of service.
