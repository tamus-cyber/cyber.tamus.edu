# SC-31 Covert Channel Analysis {#sc-31}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

a. Perform a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the system that are potential avenues for covert _**[Selection (one or more): storage; timing]**_ channels; and

b. Estimate the maximum bandwidth of those channels.
