# SC-49 Hardware-enforced Separation and Policy Enforcement {#sc-49}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Implementation Level**_: System\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Implement hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms between <strong>                  <em>[Assignment: security domains]</em>               </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

System owners may require additional strength of mechanism and robustness to ensure domain separation and policy enforcement for specific types of threats and environments of operation. Hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement provide greater strength of mechanism than software-enforced separation and policy enforcement.
