# SC-23 Session Authenticity {#sc-23}

_**Implementation Level**_: System

### Control

Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of transmitted information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against <q xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0">man-in-the-middle</q> attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions.

## SC-23(1) Invalidate Session Identifiers at Logout {#sc-23.01}

### Control

Invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Invalidating session identifiers at logout curtails the ability of adversaries to capture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs.

</details>

## SC-23(2) User-initiated Logouts and Message Displays {#sc-23.02}

<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [AC-12(1)](../../ac/ac-12#ac-12.01).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## SC-23(3) Unique System-generated Session Identifiers {#sc-23.03}

### Control

Generate a unique session identifier for each session with <strong>                     <em>[Assignment: randomness requirements]</em>                  </strong> and recognize only session identifiers that are system-generated.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Generating unique session identifiers curtails the ability of adversaries to reuse previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session identifiers protects against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers.

</details>

## SC-23(4) Unique Session Identifiers with Randomization {#sc-23.04}

<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SC-23(3)](../../sc/sc-23#sc-23.03).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## SC-23(5) Allowed Certificate Authorities {#sc-23.05}

### Control

Only allow the use of <strong>                     <em>[Assignment: certificated authorities]</em>                  </strong> for verification of the establishment of protected sessions.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Reliance on certificate authorities for the establishment of secure sessions includes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These certificates, after verification by their respective certificate authorities, facilitate the establishment of protected sessions between web clients and web servers.
