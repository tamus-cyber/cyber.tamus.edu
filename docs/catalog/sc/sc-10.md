# SC-10 Network Disconnect {#sc-10}

_**Implementation Level**_: System

### Control

Terminate the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> of inactivity.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Network disconnect applies to internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with specific communications sessions includes de-allocating TCP/IP address or port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating the networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. Periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.
