# SC-13 Cryptographic Protection {#sc-13}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control



a. Determine the <strong title="sc-13_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: cryptographic uses]</em> </strong> ; and

b. Implement the following types of cryptography required for each specified cryptographic use: <strong title="sc-13_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: types of cryptography]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions, including the protection of classified information and controlled unclassified information, the provision and implementation of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. For example, organizations that need to protect classified information may specify the use of NSA-approved cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital signatures may specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.</details>

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement



a. Encryption requirements for information storage devices and data transmissions, as well as specific requirements for portable devices, removable media, and encryption key standards and management shall be based on documented state organization risk management decisions.

b. Confidential information that is transmitted over a public network (e.g., the Internet) must be encrypted.

c. Confidential information stored in a public location that is directly accessible without compensating controls in place (e.g., FTP without access control) must be encrypted.

d. Confidential information must be encrypted if copied to, or stored on, a portable computing device, removable media, or a non-state organization owned computing device.

e. The minimum algorithm strength for protecting confidential information is a 128-bit encryption algorithm, subject to state organization risk management decisions justified and documented in accordance with 1 Texas Administrative Code Sections 202.71(c) and 202.75.
