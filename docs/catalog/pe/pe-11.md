# PE-11 Emergency Power {#pe-11}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate <strong> <em>[Selection: an orderly shutdown of the system; transition of the system to long-term alternate power]</em> </strong> in the event of a primary power source loss.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power source. A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.

## PE-11(1) Alternate Power Supply — Minimal Operational Capability {#pe-11.01}

### Control

Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated <strong> <em>[Selection: manually; automatically]</em> </strong> and that can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Provision of an alternate power supply with minimal operating capability can be satisfied by accessing a secondary commercial power supply or other external power supply.

</details>

## PE-11(2) Alternate Power Supply — Self-contained {#pe-11.02}

### Control

(a) Self-contained;

(b) Not reliant on external power generation; and

(c) Capable of maintaining <strong> <em>[Selection: minimally required operational capability; full operational capability]</em> </strong> in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

The provision of a long-term, self-contained power supply can be satisfied by using one or more generators with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the organization.
