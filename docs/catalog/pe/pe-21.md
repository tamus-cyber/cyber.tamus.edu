# PE-21 Electromagnetic Pulse Protection {#pe-21}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Employ <strong> <em>[Assignment: protective measures]</em> </strong> against electromagnetic pulse damage for <strong> <em>[Assignment: system and system components]</em> </strong>.

  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a short burst of electromagnetic energy that is spread over a range of frequencies. Such energy bursts may be natural or man-made. EMP interference may be disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment. Protective measures used to mitigate EMP risk include shielding, surge suppressors, ferro-resonant transformers, and earth grounding. EMP protection may be especially significant for systems and applications that are part of the U.S. critical infrastructure.
