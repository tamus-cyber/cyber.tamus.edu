# PE-6 Monitoring Physical Access {#pe-06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-01-20

### Control

a. Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents;

b. Review physical access logs <strong title="pe-06_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> and upon occurrence of <strong title="pe-06_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: events]</em> </strong> ; and

c. Coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response capability.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls, such as <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#au-2">AU-2</a> , if the access logs are part of an automated system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses.

## PE-6(1) Intrusion Alarms and Surveillance Equipment {#pe-06.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when unauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with physical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a response when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical intrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras installed at strategic locations throughout the facility.

## PE-6(2) Automated Intrusion Recognition and Responses {#pe-06.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Recognize <strong title="pe-06.02_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: classes or types of intrusions]</em> </strong> and initiate <strong title="pe-06.02_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: response actions]</em> </strong> using <strong title="pe-06.02_odp.03"> <em>[Assignment: automated mechanisms]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Response actions can include notifying selected organizational personnel or law enforcement personnel. Automated mechanisms implemented to initiate response actions include system alert notifications, email and text messages, and activating door locking mechanisms. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide integrated threat coverage for the organization.

## PE-6(3) Video Surveillance {#pe-06.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes\
_**Texas A&M System Required By**_: 2022-08-01

### Control

    (a) Employ video surveillance of <strong title="pe-06.03_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: operational areas]</em> </strong>;

    (b) Review video recordings <strong title="pe-06.03_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> ; and

    (c) Retain video recordings for <strong title="pe-06.03_odp.03"> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Video surveillance focuses on recording activity in specified areas for the purposes of subsequent review, if circumstances so warrant. Video recordings are typically reviewed to detect anomalous events or incidents. Monitoring the surveillance video is not required, although organizations may choose to do so. There may be legal considerations when performing and retaining video surveillance, especially if such surveillance is in a public location.

</details>

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

Ensure audio-visual surveillance technology used to monitor physical access to information systems is used responsibly and within the intended scope of the purpose for such deployment, and transparent processes and controls are implemented for the use of such technology and any resulting recorded material.

## PE-6(4) Monitoring Physical Access to Systems {#pe-06.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Monitor physical access to the system in addition to the physical access monitoring of the facility at <strong title="pe-06.04_odp"> <em>[Assignment: physical spaces]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Monitoring physical access to systems provides additional monitoring for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components, including server rooms, media storage areas, and communications centers. Physical access monitoring can be coordinated with intrusion detection systems and system monitoring capabilities to provide comprehensive and integrated threat coverage for the organization.
