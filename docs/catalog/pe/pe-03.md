# PE-3 Physical Access Control {#pe-03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a. Enforce physical access authorizations at _**[Assignment: entry and exit points]**_ by:

1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and

2. Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using _**[Selection (one or more): 
                  _**[Assignment: systems or devices]**_
               ; guards]**_;

b. Maintain physical access audit logs for _**[Assignment: entry or exit points]**_;

c. Control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible by implementing the following controls: _**[Assignment: physical access controls]**_;

d. Escort visitors and control visitor activity _**[Assignment: circumstances]**_;

e. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;

f. Inventory _**[Assignment: physical access devices]**_ every _**[Assignment: frequency]**_ ; and

g. Change combinations and keys _**[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]**_ and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the keys or combinations are transferred or terminated.
