# PE-3 Physical Access Control {#pe-03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a. Enforce physical access authorizations at <strong> <em>[Assignment: entry and exit points]</em> </strong> by:

1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and

2. Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): <strong> <em>[Assignment: systems or devices]</em> </strong> ; guards]</em> </strong>;

b. Maintain physical access audit logs for <strong> <em>[Assignment: entry or exit points]</em> </strong>;

c. Control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible by implementing the following controls: <strong> <em>[Assignment: physical access controls]</em> </strong>;

d. Escort visitors and control visitor activity <strong> <em>[Assignment: circumstances]</em> </strong>;

e. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;

f. Inventory <strong> <em>[Assignment: physical access devices]</em> </strong> every <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> ; and

g. Change combinations and keys <strong> <em>[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]</em> </strong> and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the keys or combinations are transferred or terminated.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical access controls for publicly accessible areas may include physical access control logs/records, guards, or physical access devices and barriers to prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas. Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff, system users, or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the components.

## PE-3(1) System Access {#pe-03.01}

### Control

Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at <strong> <em>[Assignment: physical spaces]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.

</details>

## PE-3(2) Facility and Systems {#pe-03.02}

### Control

Perform security checks <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> at the physical perimeter of the facility or system for exfiltration of information or removal of system components.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration.

</details>

## PE-3(3) Continuous Guards {#pe-03.03}

### Control

Employ guards to control <strong> <em>[Assignment: physical access points]</em> </strong> to the facility where the system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Employing guards at selected physical access points to the facility provides a more rapid response capability for organizations. Guards also provide the opportunity for human surveillance in areas of the facility not covered by video surveillance.

</details>

## PE-3(4) Lockable Casings {#pe-03.04}

### Control

Use lockable physical casings to protect <strong> <em>[Assignment: system components]</em> </strong> from unauthorized physical access.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

The greatest risk from the use of portable devices—such as smart phones, tablets, and notebook computers—is theft. Organizations can employ lockable, physical casings to reduce or eliminate the risk of equipment theft. Such casings come in a variety of sizes, from units that protect a single notebook computer to full cabinets that can protect multiple servers, computers, and peripherals. Lockable physical casings can be used in conjunction with cable locks or lockdown plates to prevent the theft of the locked casing containing the computer equipment.

</details>

## PE-3(5) Tamper Protection {#pe-03.05}

### Control

Employ <strong> <em>[Assignment: anti-tamper technologies]</em> </strong> to <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): detect; prevent]</em> </strong> physical tampering or alteration of <strong> <em>[Assignment: hardware components]</em> </strong> within the system.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Organizations can implement tamper detection and prevention at selected hardware components or implement tamper detection at some components and tamper prevention at other components. Detection and prevention activities can employ many types of anti-tamper technologies, including tamper-detection seals and anti-tamper coatings. Anti-tamper programs help to detect hardware alterations through counterfeiting and other supply chain-related risks.

</details>

## PE-3(6) Facility Penetration Testing {#pe-03.06}

<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [CA-8](../../ca/ca-08#ca-08).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## PE-3(7) Physical Barriers {#pe-03.07}

### Control

Limit access using physical barriers.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Physical barriers include bollards, concrete slabs, jersey walls, and hydraulic active vehicle barriers.

</details>

## PE-3(8) Access Control Vestibules {#pe-03.08}

### Control

Employ access control vestibules at <strong> <em>[Assignment: locations]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

An access control vestibule is part of a physical access control system that typically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Vestibules are designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with controlled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in unauthorized access to the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the number of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment areas while authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door controllers can be fully automated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing of the doors) or partially automated (i.e., using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the containment area).
