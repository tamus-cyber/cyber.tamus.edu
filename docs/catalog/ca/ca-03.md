# CA-3 Information Exchange {#ca-03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a. Approve and manage the exchange of information between the system and other systems using <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): interconnection security agreements; information exchange security agreements; memoranda of understanding or agreement; service level agreements; user agreements; non-disclosure agreements; <strong> <em>[Assignment: type of agreement]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong>;

b. Document, as part of each exchange agreement, the interface characteristics, security and privacy requirements, controls, and responsibilities for each system, and the impact level of the information communicated; and

c. Review and update the agreements <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

System information exchange requirements apply to information exchanges between two or more systems. System information exchanges include connections via leased lines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service providers, database sharing or exchanges of database transaction information, connections and exchanges with cloud services, exchanges via web-based services, or exchanges of files via file transfer protocols, network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization-to-organization communications. Organizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats that may be introduced when systems exchange information with other systems that may have different security and privacy requirements and controls. This includes systems within the same organization and systems that are external to the organization. A joint authorization of the systems exchanging information, as described in <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ca-6.1">CA-6(1)</a> or <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ca-6.2">CA-6(2)</a> , may help to communicate and reduce risk.

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

Information resources assigned from or shared between one state agency to another or from or between a state agency to a third-party shall be protected in accordance with the conditions imposed by the providing state agency at a minimum.

## CA-3(6) Transfer Authorizations {#ca-03.06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Verify that individuals or systems transferring data between interconnecting systems have the requisite authorizations (i.e., write permissions or privileges) prior to accepting such data.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

To prevent unauthorized individuals and systems from making information transfers to protected systems, the protected system verifies—via independent means— whether the individual or system attempting to transfer information is authorized to do so. Verification of the authorization to transfer information also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS) and services (e.g., authenticated SMTP relays).

</details>

## CA-3(7) Transitive Information Exchanges {#ca-03.07}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

    (a) Identify transitive (downstream) information exchanges with other systems through the systems identified in <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ca-3_smt.a">CA-3a</a> ; and

    (b) Take measures to ensure that transitive (downstream) information exchanges cease when the controls on identified transitive (downstream) systems cannot be verified or validated.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Transitive or <q xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0">downstream</q> information exchanges are information exchanges between the system or systems with which the organizational system exchanges information and other systems. For mission-essential systems, services, and applications, including high value assets, it is necessary to identify such information exchanges. The transparency of the controls or protection measures in place in such downstream systems connected directly or indirectly to organizational systems is essential to understanding the security and privacy risks resulting from those information exchanges. Organizational systems can inherit risk from downstream systems through transitive connections and information exchanges, which can make the organizational systems more susceptible to threats, hazards, and adverse impacts.
