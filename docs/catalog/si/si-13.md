# SI-13 Predictable Failure Prevention {#si-13}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control



a. Determine mean time to failure (MTTF) for the following system components in specific environments of operation: <strong title="si-13_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: system components]</em> </strong> ; and

b. Provide substitute system components and a means to exchange active and standby components in accordance with the following criteria: <strong title="si-13_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: mean time to failure (MTTF) substitution criteria]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, predictable failure prevention is intended to address potential failures of system components that provide security capabilities. Failure rates reflect installation-specific consideration rather than the industry-average. Organizations define the criteria for the substitution of system components based on the MTTF value with consideration for the potential harm from component failures. The transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capabilities. The preservation of system state variables is also critical to help ensure a successful transfer process. Standby components remain available at all times except for maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.</details>


## SI-13(1) Transferring Component Responsibilities {#si-13.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Take system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than <strong title="si-13.01_odp"> <em>[Assignment: fraction or percentage]</em> </strong> of mean time to failure.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Transferring primary system component responsibilities to other substitute components prior to primary component failure is important to reduce the risk of degraded or debilitated mission or business functions. Making such transfers based on a percentage of mean time to failure allows organizations to be proactive based on their risk tolerance. However, the premature replacement of system components can result in the increased cost of system operations.</details>


## SI-13(2) Time Limit on Process Execution Without Supervision {#si-13.02}

### Control

<em>[Withdrawn; incorporated into [SI-7(16)](/catalog/si/si-07#si-07.16).]</em>



## SI-13(3) Manual Transfer Between Components {#si-13.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Manually initiate transfers between active and standby system components when the use of the active component reaches <strong title="si-13.03_odp"> <em>[Assignment: percentage]</em> </strong> of the mean time to failure.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>For example, if the MTTF for a system component is 100 days and the MTTF percentage defined by the organization is 90 percent, the manual transfer would occur after 90 days.</details>


## SI-13(4) Standby Component Installation and Notification {#si-13.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

If system component failures are detected:

    (a) Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within <strong title="si-13.04_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> ; and

    (b) <strong title="si-13.04_odp.02"> <em>[Selection (one-or-more): activate <strong title="si-13.04_odp.03"> <em>[Assignment: alarm]</em> </strong>; automatically shut down the system; <strong title="si-13.04_odp.04"> <em>[Assignment: action]</em> </strong>]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur upon the detection of component failures.</details>


## SI-13(5) Failover Capability {#si-13.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Provide <strong title="si-13.05_odp.01"> <em>[Selection: real-time; near real-time]</em> </strong> <strong title="si-13.05_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: failover capability]</em> </strong> for the system.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate system upon the failure of the primary system. Failover capability includes incorporating mirrored system operations at alternate processing sites or periodic data mirroring at regular intervals defined by the recovery time periods of organizations.</details>
