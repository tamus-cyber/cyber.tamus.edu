## SI-13(1) Transferring Component Responsibilities {#si-13.01}

### Control

Take system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than _**[Assignment: fraction or percentage]**_ of mean time to failure.

## SI-13(2) Time Limit on Process Execution Without Supervision {#si-13.02}

_[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SI-7(16)](../si/si-07#si-07.16).]_

## SI-13(3) Manual Transfer Between Components {#si-13.03}

### Control

Manually initiate transfers between active and standby system components when the use of the active component reaches _**[Assignment: percentage]**_ of the mean time to failure.

## SI-13(4) Standby Component Installation and Notification {#si-13.04}

### Control

(a) Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within _**[Assignment: time period]**_ ; and

(b) 
                     _**[Selection (one or more): activate _**[Assignment: alarm]**_
                  ; automatically shut down the system; 
                     _**[Assignment: action]**_
                  ]**_.

## SI-13(5) Failover Capability {#si-13.05}

### Control

Provide _**[Selection: real-time; near real-time]**_
                  _**[Assignment: failover capability]**_ for the system.
