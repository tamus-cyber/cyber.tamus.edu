# SI-13 Predictable Failure Prevention {#si-13}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

a. Determine mean time to failure (MTTF) for the following system components in specific environments of operation: <strong> <em>[Assignment: system components]</em> </strong> ; and

b. Provide substitute system components and a means to exchange active and standby components in accordance with the following criteria: <strong> <em>[Assignment: mean time to failure (MTTF) substitution criteria]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, predictable failure prevention is intended to address potential failures of system components that provide security capabilities. Failure rates reflect installation-specific consideration rather than the industry-average. Organizations define the criteria for the substitution of system components based on the MTTF value with consideration for the potential harm from component failures. The transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capabilities. The preservation of system state variables is also critical to help ensure a successful transfer process. Standby components remain available at all times except for maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.

## SI-13(1) Transferring Component Responsibilities {#si-13.01}

### Control

Take system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than <strong> <em>[Assignment: fraction or percentage]</em> </strong> of mean time to failure.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Transferring primary system component responsibilities to other substitute components prior to primary component failure is important to reduce the risk of degraded or debilitated mission or business functions. Making such transfers based on a percentage of mean time to failure allows organizations to be proactive based on their risk tolerance. However, the premature replacement of system components can result in the increased cost of system operations.

## SI-13(2) Time Limit on Process Execution Without Supervision {#si-13.02}

<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SI-7(16)](../../si/si-07#si-07.16).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## SI-13(3) Manual Transfer Between Components {#si-13.03}

### Control

Manually initiate transfers between active and standby system components when the use of the active component reaches <strong> <em>[Assignment: percentage]</em> </strong> of the mean time to failure.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

For example, if the MTTF for a system component is 100 days and the MTTF percentage defined by the organization is 90 percent, the manual transfer would occur after 90 days.

</details>

## SI-13(4) Standby Component Installation and Notification {#si-13.04}

### Control

(a) Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> ; and

(b)  <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): activate <strong> <em>[Assignment: alarm]</em> </strong> ; automatically shut down the system; <strong> <em>[Assignment: action]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Automatic or manual transfer of components from standby to active mode can occur upon the detection of component failures.

</details>

## SI-13(5) Failover Capability {#si-13.05}

### Control

Provide <strong> <em>[Selection: real-time; near real-time]</em> </strong> <strong> <em>[Assignment: failover capability]</em> </strong> for the system.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate system upon the failure of the primary system. Failover capability includes incorporating mirrored system operations at alternate processing sites or periodic data mirroring at regular intervals defined by the recovery time periods of organizations.
