<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Prohibit archiving of personally identifiable information elements if those elements in a dataset will not be needed after the dataset is archived.

</details>

## SI-19(3) Release {#si-19.03}

### Control

Remove personally identifiable information elements from a dataset prior to its release if those elements in the dataset do not need to be part of the data release.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Remove personally identifiable information elements from a dataset prior to its release if those elements in the dataset do not need to be part of the data release.

</details>

## SI-19(4) Removal, Masking, Encryption, Hashing, or Replacement of Direct Identifiers {#si-19.04}

### Control

Remove, mask, encrypt, hash, or replace direct identifiers in a dataset.

<details>

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Manipulate numerical data, contingency tables, and statistical findings so that no individual or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis.

</details>

## SI-19(6) Differential Privacy {#si-19.06}

### Control

Prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information by adding non-deterministic noise to the results of mathematical operations before the results are reported.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information by adding non-deterministic noise to the results of mathematical operations before the results are reported.

</details>

## SI-19(7) Validated Algorithms and Software {#si-19.07}

### Control

Perform de-identification using validated algorithms and software that is validated to implement the algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Perform de-identification using validated algorithms and software that is validated to implement the algorithms.

</details>

## SI-19(8) Motivated Intruder {#si-19.08}

### Control

Perform a motivated intruder test on the de-identified dataset to determine if the identified data remains or if the de-identified data can be re-identified.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Perform a motivated intruder test on the de-identified dataset to determine if the identified data remains or if the de-identified data can be re-identified.
