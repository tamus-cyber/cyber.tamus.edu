b. Perform the verification of the functions specified in SI-6a <strong title="si-06_odp.03"> <em>[Selection (one-or-more): <strong title="si-06_odp.04"> <em>[Assignment: system transitional states]</em> </strong>; upon command by user with appropriate privilege; <strong title="si-06_odp.05"> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong>]</em> </strong>;

c. Alert <strong title="si-06_odp.06"> <em>[Assignment: personnel or roles]</em> </strong> to failed security and privacy verification tests; and

d. <strong title="si-06_odp.07"> <em>[Selection (one-or-more): shut the system down; restart the system; <strong title="si-06_odp.08"> <em>[Assignment: alternative action(s)]</em> </strong>]</em> </strong> when anomalies are discovered.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Transitional states for systems include system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort. System notifications include hardware indicator lights, electronic alerts to system administrators, and messages to local computer consoles.
