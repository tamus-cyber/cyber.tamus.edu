# SI-3 Malicious Code Protection {#si-03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Implementation Level**_: System\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a. Implement _**[Selection (one or more): signature-based; non-signature-based]**_ malicious code protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code;

b. Automatically update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;

c. Configure malicious code protection mechanisms to:

1. Perform periodic scans of the system _**[Assignment: frequency]**_ and real-time scans of files from external sources at _**[Selection (one or more): endpoint; network entry and exit points]**_ as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational policy; and

2. 
                     _**[Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code; take _**[Assignment: action]**_
               ]**_ ; and send alert to _**[Assignment: personnel or roles]**_ in response to malicious code detection; and

d. Address the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the system.
