# SI-8 Spam Protection {#si-08}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

a. Employ spam protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect and act on unsolicited messages; and

b. Update spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

System entry and exit points include firewalls, remote-access servers, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices.

## SI-8(3) Continuous Learning Capability {#si-08.03}

### Control

Implement spam protection mechanisms with a learning capability to more effectively identify legitimate communications traffic.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Learning mechanisms include Bayesian filters that respond to user inputs that identify specific traffic as spam or legitimate by updating algorithm parameters and thereby more accurately separating types of traffic.
