# AU-12 Audit Record Generation {#au-12}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control



a. Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing as defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a) on <strong title="au-12_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: system components]</em> </strong>;

b. Allow <strong title="au-12_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: personnel or roles]</em> </strong> to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and

c. Generate audit records for the event types defined in [AU-2c](#au-2_smt.c) that include the audit record content defined in [AU-3](/catalog/au/au-03#au-03).


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.</details>


## AU-12(1) System-wide and Time-correlated Audit Trail {#au-12.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Compile audit records from <strong title="au-12.01_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: system components]</em> </strong> into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within <strong title="au-12.01_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: level of tolerance]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.</details>


## AU-12(2) Standardized Formats {#au-12.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Produce a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit records in a standardized format.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Audit records that follow common standards promote interoperability and information exchange between devices and systems. Promoting interoperability and information exchange facilitates the production of event information that can be readily analyzed and correlated. If logging mechanisms do not conform to standardized formats, systems may convert individual audit records into standardized formats when compiling system-wide audit trails.</details>


## AU-12(3) Changes by Authorized Individuals {#au-12.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Provide and implement the capability for <strong title="au-12.03_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: individuals or roles]</em> </strong> to change the logging to be performed on <strong title="au-12.03_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: system components]</em> </strong> based on <strong title="au-12.03_odp.03"> <em>[Assignment: selectable event criteria]</em> </strong> within <strong title="au-12.03_odp.04"> <em>[Assignment: time thresholds]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Permitting authorized individuals to make changes to system logging enables organizations to extend or limit logging as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Logging that is limited to conserve system resources may be extended (either temporarily or permanently) to address certain threat situations. In addition, logging may be limited to a specific set of event types to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which logging actions are changed (e.g., near real-time, within minutes, or within hours).</details>


## AU-12(4) Query Parameter Audits of Personally Identifiable Information {#au-12.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Provide and implement the capability for auditing the parameters of user query events for data sets containing personally identifiable information.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Query parameters are explicit criteria that an individual or automated system submits to a system to retrieve data. Auditing of query parameters for datasets that contain personally identifiable information augments the capability of an organization to track and understand the access, usage, or sharing of personally identifiable information by authorized personnel.</details>
