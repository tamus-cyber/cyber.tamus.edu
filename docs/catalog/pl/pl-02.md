# PL-2 System Security and Privacy Plans {#pl-02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a. Develop security and privacy plans for the system that:

1. Are consistent with the organizationâ€™s enterprise architecture;

2. Explicitly define the constituent system components;

3. Describe the operational context of the system in terms of mission and business processes;

4. Identify the individuals that fulfill system roles and responsibilities;

5. Identify the information types processed, stored, and transmitted by the system;

6. Provide the security categorization of the system, including supporting rationale;

7. Describe any specific threats to the system that are of concern to the organization;

8. Provide the results of a privacy risk assessment for systems processing personally identifiable information;

9. Describe the operational environment for the system and any dependencies on or connections to other systems or system components;

10. Provide an overview of the security and privacy requirements for the system;

11. Identify any relevant control baselines or overlays, if applicable;

12. Describe the controls in place or planned for meeting the security and privacy requirements, including a rationale for any tailoring decisions;

13. Include risk determinations for security and privacy architecture and design decisions;

14. Include security- and privacy-related activities affecting the system that require planning and coordination with <strong> <em>[Assignment: individuals or groups]</em> </strong> ; and

15. Are reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to plan implementation.

b. Distribute copies of the plans and communicate subsequent changes to the plans to <strong> <em>[Assignment: personnel or roles]</em> </strong>;

c. Review the plans <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong>;

d. Update the plans to address changes to the system and environment of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or control assessments; and

e. Protect the plans from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

System security and privacy plans are scoped to the system and system components within the defined authorization boundary and contain an overview of the security and privacy requirements for the system and the controls selected to satisfy the requirements. The plans describe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the system with a sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently assess the effectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for proposal, and design reviews). <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#c3397cc9-83c6-4459-adb2-836739dc1b94">Section 2.1</a> describes the different types of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls.
