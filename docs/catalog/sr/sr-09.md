# SR-9 Tamper Resistance and Detection {#sr-09}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Implement a tamper protection program for the system, system component, or system service.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques provide a level of protection for systems, system components, and services against many threats, including reverse engineering, modification, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting systems and components during distribution and when in use.</details>


## SR-9(1) Multiple Stages of System Development Life Cycle {#sr-09.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques throughout the system development life cycle.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>The system development life cycle includes research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal. Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations use obfuscation and self-checking to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The customization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.</details>
