### Control

Prevent the installation of <strong> <em>[Assignment: organization-defined software and firmware components]</em> </strong> without verification that the component has been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed with recognized and approved certificates include software and firmware version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input/output system updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures is a method of code authentication.
