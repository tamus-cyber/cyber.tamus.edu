# CM-7 Least Functionality {#cm-07}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control



a. Configure the system to provide only <strong title="cm-07_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: mission-essential capabilities]</em> </strong> ; and

b. Prohibit or restrict the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services: <strong title="cm-7_prm_2"> <em>[Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, system ports, protocols, software, and/or services]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see [SA-8](/catalog/sa/sa-08), [SC-2](/catalog/sc/sc-02) , and [SC-3](/catalog/sc/sc-03)).</details>


## CM-7(1) Periodic Review {#cm-07.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System\
_**Texas A&M System Baseline**_: MODERATE\
_**Texas A&M System Required By**_: 2025-06-01

### Control



    (a) Review the system <strong title="cm-07.01_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, software, and services; and

    (b) Disable or remove <strong title="cm-7.1_prm_2"> <em>[Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, software, and services within the system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Organizations review functions, ports, protocols, and services provided by systems or system components to determine the functions and services that are candidates for elimination. Such reviews are especially important during transition periods from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transition from IPv4 to IPv6). These technology transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and returning to minimum essential functions, ports, protocols, and services at the earliest opportunity. Organizations can either decide the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Unsecure protocols include Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking.</details>


## CM-7(2) Prevent Program Execution {#cm-07.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Prevent program execution in accordance with <strong title="cm-07.02_odp.01"> <em>[Selection (one-or-more): <strong title="cm-07.02_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: policies, rules of behavior, and/or access agreements regarding software program usage and restrictions]</em> </strong>; rules authorizing the terms and conditions of software program usage]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Prevention of program execution addresses organizational policies, rules of behavior, and/or access agreements that restrict software usage and the terms and conditions imposed by the developer or manufacturer, including software licensing and copyrights. Restrictions include prohibiting auto-execute features, restricting roles allowed to approve program execution, permitting or prohibiting specific software programs, or restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time.</details>


## CM-7(3) Registration Compliance {#cm-07.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Ensure compliance with <strong title="cm-07.03_odp"> <em>[Assignment: registration requirements]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Organizations use the registration process to manage, track, and provide oversight for systems and implemented functions, ports, protocols, and services.</details>


## CM-7(4) Unauthorized Software — Deny-by-exception {#cm-07.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control



    (a) Identify <strong title="cm-07.04_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: software programs]</em> </strong>;

    (b) Employ an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized software programs on the system; and

    (c) Review and update the list of unauthorized software programs <strong title="cm-07.04_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Unauthorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a specific source. The concept of prohibiting the execution of unauthorized software may also be applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and MAC addresses.</details>


## CM-7(5) Authorized Software — Allow-by-exception {#cm-07.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control



    (a) Identify <strong title="cm-07.05_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: software programs]</em> </strong>;

    (b) Employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs on the system; and

    (c) Review and update the list of authorized software programs <strong title="cm-07.05_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong>.


<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a specific source. To facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and increase the strength of protection for attacks that bypass application level authorized software, software programs may be decomposed into and monitored at different levels of detail. These levels include applications, application programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries. The concept of permitting the execution of authorized software may also be applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges, websites, and MAC addresses. Organizations consider verifying the integrity of authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic checksums, or hash functions. Verification of authorized software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. The identification of authorized URLs for websites is addressed in [CA-3(5)](/catalog/ca/ca-03#ca-03.05) and [SC-7](/catalog/sc/sc-07).</details>


## CM-7(6) Confined Environments with Limited Privileges {#cm-07.06}
