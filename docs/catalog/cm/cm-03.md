# CM-3 Configuration Change Control {#cm-03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: MODERATE\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2024-11-18\
_**Texas A&M System Required By**_: 2022-08-01

### Control

a. Determine and document the types of changes to the system that are configuration-controlled;

b. Review proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system and approve or disapprove such changes with explicit consideration for security and privacy impact analyses;

c. Document configuration change decisions associated with the system;

d. Implement approved configuration-controlled changes to the system;

e. Retain records of configuration-controlled changes to the system for _**[Assignment: time period]**_;

f. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system; and

g. Coordinate and provide oversight for configuration change control activities through _**[Assignment: configuration change control element]**_ that convenes _**[Selection (one or more): 
                  _**[Assignment: frequency]**_
               ; when _**[Assignment: configuration change conditions]**_
               ]**_.
