c. Document configuration change decisions associated with the system;

d. Implement approved configuration-controlled changes to the system;

e. Retain records of configuration-controlled changes to the system for <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong>;

f. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system; and

g. Coordinate and provide oversight for configuration change control activities through <strong> <em>[Assignment: configuration change control element]</em> </strong> that convenes <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> ; when <strong> <em>[Assignment: configuration change conditions]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of system changes, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations, configuration items of systems, operational procedures, configuration settings for system components, remediate vulnerabilities, and unscheduled or unauthorized changes. Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes. For changes that impact privacy risk, the senior agency official for privacy updates privacy impact assessments and system of records notices. For new systems or major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from the development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes are made to systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

All security-related information resources changes shall be approved by the information owner (or designee) through a change control process.

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

Incorporate change management processes to ensure secure, reliable, and stable operations to which all offices that support information systems adhere. Ensure the change management process incorporates guidelines that address:

a. formally identifying, classifying, prioritizing, and requesting changes;

b. identifying and deploying emergency changes;

c. assessing potential impacts from changes;

d. authorizing changes and exceptions, and

e. implementing changes and planning for back-outs.

## CM-3(1) Automated Documentation, Notification, and Prohibition of Changes {#cm-03.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Use <strong> <em>[Assignment: automated mechanisms]</em> </strong> to:

    (a) Document proposed changes to the system;

    (b) Notify <strong> <em>[Assignment: approval authorities]</em> </strong> of proposed changes to the system and request change approval;

    (c) Highlight proposed changes to the system that have not been approved or disapproved within <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong>;

    (d) Prohibit changes to the system until designated approvals are received;

    (e) Document all changes to the system; and

    (f) Notify <strong> <em>[Assignment: personnel]</em> </strong> when approved changes to the system are completed.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

None.

## CM-3(2) Testing, Validation, and Documentation of Changes {#cm-03.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes\
_**Texas A&M System Required By**_: 2022-08-01

### Control

Test, validate, and document changes to the system before finalizing the implementation of the changes.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Changes to systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware components and configuration settings defined in <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#cm-6">CM-6</a> . Organizations ensure that testing does not interfere with system operations that support organizational mission and business functions. Individuals or groups conducting tests understand security and privacy policies and procedures, system security and privacy policies and procedures, and the health, safety, and environmental risks associated with specific facilities or processes. Operational systems may need to be taken offline, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If systems must be taken offline for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible. If the testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ compensating controls.

## CM-3(3) Automated Change Implementation {#cm-03.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Implement changes to the current system baseline and deploy the updated baseline across the installed base using <strong> <em>[Assignment: automated mechanisms]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Automated tools can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration baseline information. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.

</details>

## CM-3(4) Security and Privacy Representatives {#cm-03.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Require <strong> <em>[Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy representatives]</em> </strong> to be members of the <strong> <em>[Assignment: configuration change control element]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Information security and privacy representatives include system security officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, or system privacy officers. Representation by personnel with information security and privacy expertise is important because changes to system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be security- or privacy-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security and privacy posture of systems. The configuration change control element referred to in the second organization-defined parameter reflects the change control elements defined by organizations in <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#cm-3_smt.g">CM-3g</a>.

## CM-3(5) Automated Security Response {#cm-03.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Implement the following security responses automatically if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner: <strong> <em>[Assignment: security responses]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Automated security responses include halting selected system functions, halting system processing, and issuing alerts or notifications to organizational personnel when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

</details>

## CM-3(6) Cryptography Management {#cm-03.06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Ensure that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide the following controls are under configuration management: <strong> <em>[Assignment: controls]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

The controls referenced in the control enhancement refer to security and privacy controls from the control catalog. Regardless of the cryptographic mechanisms employed, processes and procedures are in place to manage those mechanisms. For example, if system components use certificates for identification and authentication, a process is implemented to address the expiration of those certificates.
