  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

A Data Integrity Board is the board of senior officials designated by the head of a federal agency and is responsible for, among other things, reviewing the agencyâ€™s proposals to conduct or participate in a matching program and conducting an annual review of all matching programs in which the agency has participated. As a general matter, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to Federal benefit programs or Federal personnel or payroll records. At a minimum, the Data Integrity Board includes the Inspector General of the agency, if any, and the senior agency official for privacy.
