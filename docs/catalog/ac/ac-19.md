# AC-19 Access Control for Mobile Devices {#ac-19}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20\
_**Texas A&M System Required By**_: 2022-12-19

### Control

a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and

b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.

  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

State organizations shall establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, whether owned by the state organization or the employee.

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

Require the implementation of a mobile device management (MDM) product on all organization-controlled mobile devices.

    (1) Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified systems is prohibited;

    (2) Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified systems requires approval from the authorizing official;

    (3) Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the unclassified mobile devices is prohibited; and

    (4) Unclassified mobile devices and the information stored on those devices are subject to random reviews and inspections by <strong> <em>[Assignment: security officials]</em> </strong> , and if classified information is found, the incident handling policy is followed.

## AC-19(5) Full Device or Container-based Encryption {#ac-19.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Employ <strong> <em>[Selection: full-device encryption; container-based encryption]</em> </strong> to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on <strong> <em>[Assignment: mobile devices]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to data and information encryption on mobile devices, including encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields.
