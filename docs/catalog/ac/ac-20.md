# AC-20 Use of External Systems {#ac-20}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a.  <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): establish <strong> <em>[Assignment: terms and conditions]</em> </strong> ; identify <strong> <em>[Assignment: controls asserted]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong> , consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:

1. Access the system from external systems; and

2. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; or

b. Prohibit the use of <strong> <em>[Assignment: prohibited types of external systems]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems, and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

Each state agency entering into or renewing a contract with a vendor authorized to access, transmit, use, or store data for the agency shall include a provision in the contract requiring the vendor to meet the security controls the agency determines are proportionate with the agency's risk under the contract based on the sensitivity of the agency's data. A state agency must require the vendor to periodically provide evidence to the agency that the vendor meets the security controls required under the contract.

## AC-20(1) Limits on Authorized Use {#ac-20.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:

    (a) Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or

    (b) Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external system.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using external systems may need to access organizational systems. Organizations need assurance that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been implemented can be achieved by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.

## AC-20(2) Portable Storage Devices — Restricted Use {#ac-20.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized individuals on external systems using <strong> <em>[Assignment: restrictions]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external systems include restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices may be used.

</details>

## AC-20(3) Non-organizationally Owned Systems — Restricted Use {#ac-20.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Restrict the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, store, or transmit organizational information using <strong> <em>[Assignment: restrictions]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or system components owned by other organizations as well as personally owned devices. There are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems or components. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use (see <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ac-20_smt.b">AC-20 b.</a> ). In other cases, the use of such systems or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing the connection of non-organizationally owned systems and components; limiting access to types of information, services, or applications; using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or system components provisioned by the organization; and agreeing to the terms and conditions for usage. Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally owned devices, including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.

## AC-20(4) Network Accessible Storage Devices — Prohibited Use {#ac-20.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Prohibit the use of <strong> <em>[Assignment: network-accessible storage devices]</em> </strong> in external systems.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Network-accessible storage devices in external systems include online storage devices in public, hybrid, or community cloud-based systems.

</details>

## AC-20(5) Portable Storage Devices — Prohibited Use {#ac-20.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Prohibit the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized individuals on external systems.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external systems include a complete prohibition of the use of such devices. Prohibiting such use is enforced using technical methods and/or nontechnical (i.e., process-based) methods.
