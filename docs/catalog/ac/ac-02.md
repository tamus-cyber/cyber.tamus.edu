# AC-2 Account Management {#ac-02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a. Define and document the types of accounts allowed and specifically prohibited for use within the system;

b. Assign account managers;

c. Require <strong> <em>[Assignment: prerequisites and criteria]</em> </strong> for group and role membership;

d. Specify:

1. Authorized users of the system;

2. Group and role membership; and

3. Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and <strong> <em>[Assignment: attributes (as required)]</em> </strong> for each account;

e. Require approvals by <strong> <em>[Assignment: personnel or roles]</em> </strong> for requests to create accounts;

f. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with <strong> <em>[Assignment: policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria]</em> </strong>;

g. Monitor the use of accounts;

h. Notify account managers and <strong> <em>[Assignment: personnel or roles]</em> </strong> within:

1.  <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> when accounts are no longer required;

2.  <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> when users are terminated or transferred; and

3.  <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> when system usage or need-to-know changes for an individual;

i. Authorize access to the system based on:

1. A valid access authorization;

2. Intended system usage; and

3.  <strong> <em>[Assignment: attributes (as required)]</em> </strong>;

j. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong>;

k. Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and

l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.

## AC-2(1) Automated System Account Management {#ac-02.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Support the management of system accounts using <strong> <em>[Assignment: automated mechanisms]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Automated system account management includes using automated mechanisms to create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts; notify account managers when an account is created, enabled, modified, disabled, or removed, or when users are terminated or transferred; monitor system account usage; and report atypical system account usage. Automated mechanisms can include internal system functions and email, telephonic, and text messaging notifications.

</details>

## AC-2(2) Automated Temporary and Emergency Account Management {#ac-02.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Automatically <strong> <em>[Selection: remove; disable]</em> </strong> temporary and emergency accounts after <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation.

</details>

## AC-2(3) Disable Accounts {#ac-02.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: MODERATE\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2024-11-18

### Control

Disable accounts within <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> when the accounts:

    (a) Have expired;

    (b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual;

    (c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or

    (d) Have been inactive for <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the concepts of least privilege and least functionality which reduce the attack surface of the system.

</details>

## AC-2(4) Automated Audit Actions {#ac-02.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Automatically audit account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Account management audit records are defined in accordance with <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#au-2">AU-02</a> and reviewed, analyzed, and reported in accordance with <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#au-6">AU-06</a>.

</details>

## AC-2(5) Inactivity Logout {#ac-02.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control

Require that users log out when <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period of expected inactivity or description of when to log out]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ac-11">AC-11</a>.

</details>

## AC-2(6) Dynamic Privilege Management {#ac-02.06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Implement <strong> <em>[Assignment: dynamic privilege management capabilities]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

In contrast to access control approaches that employ static accounts and predefined user privileges, dynamic access control approaches rely on runtime access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management, such as attribute-based access control. While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user privileges typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business requirements and the operational needs of organizations. An example of dynamic privilege management is the immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, if their job function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege management includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes to encryption keys used for communications.

</details>

## AC-2(7) Privileged User Accounts {#ac-02.07}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Texas A&M System Required By**_: 2022-08-01

### Control

    (a) Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with <strong> <em>[Selection: a role-based access scheme; an attribute-based access scheme]</em> </strong>;

    (b) Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;

    (c) Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and

    (d) Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management, database administration, system and network administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes.

</details>

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

Ensure users with privileged (also known as administrative or special access) accounts are aware of the extraordinary responsibilities associated with the use of privileged accounts.

## AC-2(8) Dynamic Account Management {#ac-02.08}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Create, activate, manage, and deactivate <strong> <em>[Assignment: system accounts]</em> </strong> dynamically.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Approaches for dynamically creating, activating, managing, and deactivating system accounts rely on automatically provisioning the accounts at runtime for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for the dynamic management, creation, activation, and deactivation of system accounts by establishing trust relationships, business rules, and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges.

</details>

## AC-2(9) Restrictions on Use of Shared and Group Accounts {#ac-02.09}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet <strong> <em>[Assignment: conditions]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Before permitting the use of shared or group accounts, organizations consider the increased risk due to the lack of accountability with such accounts.

</details>

## AC-2(10) Shared and Group Account Credential Change {#ac-02.10}


<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into k.]</em>
            </prop>
            

## AC-2(11) Usage Conditions {#ac-02.11}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Enforce <strong> <em>[Assignment: circumstances and/or usage conditions]</em> </strong> for <strong> <em>[Assignment: system accounts]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Specifying and enforcing usage conditions helps to enforce the principle of least privilege, increase user accountability, and enable effective account monitoring. Account monitoring includes alerts generated if the account is used in violation of organizational parameters. Organizations can describe specific conditions or circumstances under which system accounts can be used, such as by restricting usage to certain days of the week, time of day, or specific durations of time.

</details>

## AC-2(12) Account Monitoring for Atypical Usage {#ac-02.12}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control

    (a) Monitor system accounts for <strong> <em>[Assignment: atypical usage]</em> </strong> ; and

    (b) Report atypical usage of system accounts to <strong> <em>[Assignment: personnel or roles]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Atypical usage includes accessing systems at certain times of the day or from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of individuals. Monitoring for atypical usage may reveal rogue behavior by individuals or an attack in progress. Account monitoring may inadvertently create privacy risks since data collected to identify atypical usage may reveal previously unknown information about the behavior of individuals. Organizations assess and document privacy risks from monitoring accounts for atypical usage in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy program plan.

</details>

## AC-2(13) Disable Accounts for High-risk Individuals {#ac-02.13}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Disable accounts of individuals within <strong> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong> of discovery of <strong> <em>[Assignment: significant risks]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Users who pose a significant security and/or privacy risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Such harm includes adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination among system administrators, legal staff, human resource managers, and authorizing officials is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals.
