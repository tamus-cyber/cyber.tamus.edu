<details><summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of the incident response capabilities, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of information with external organizations, including external service providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain. For incidents involving personally identifiable information (i.e., breaches), include a process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and provide that notice accordingly.</details>

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

State agencies shall assess the significance of a security incident based upon the business impact on the affected resources and the current and potential technical effect of the incident, e.g., loss of revenue, productivity, access to services, reputation, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, or propagation to other networks. Incident response plans shall be reviewed every two years at a minimum.
