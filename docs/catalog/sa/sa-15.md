# SA-15 Development Process, Standards, and Tools {#sa-15}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

a. Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a documented development process that:

1. Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;

2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;

3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and

4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and

b. Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> to determine if the process, standards, tools, tool options and tool configurations selected and employed can satisfy the following security and privacy requirements: <strong> <em>[Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy requirements]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Development tools include programming languages and computer-aided design systems. Reviews of development processes include the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes facilitates effective supply chain risk assessment and mitigation. Such integrity requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.

</details>

## SA-15(1) Quality Metrics {#sa-15.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

    (a) Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and

    (b) Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): <strong> <em>[Assignment: frequency]</em> </strong> ; <strong> <em>[Assignment: program review]</em> </strong> ; upon delivery]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Organizations use quality metrics to establish acceptable levels of system quality. Metrics can include quality gates, which are collections of completion criteria or sufficiency standards that represent the satisfactory execution of specific phases of the system development project. For example, a quality gate may require the elimination of all compiler warnings or a determination that such warnings have no impact on the effectiveness of required security or privacy capabilities. During the execution phases of development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress. Other metrics apply to the entire development project. Metrics can include defining the severity thresholds of vulnerabilities in accordance with organizational risk tolerance, such as requiring no known vulnerabilities in the delivered system with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity of medium or high.

## SA-15(2) Security and Privacy Tracking Tools {#sa-15.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to select and employ security and privacy tracking tools for use during the development process.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

System development teams select and deploy security and privacy tracking tools, including vulnerability or work item tracking systems that facilitate assignment, sorting, filtering, and tracking of completed work items or tasks associated with development processes.

</details>

## SA-15(3) Criticality Analysis {#sa-15.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality analysis:

    (a) At the following decision points in the system development life cycle: <strong> <em>[Assignment: decision points]</em> </strong> ; and

    (b) At the following level of rigor: <strong> <em>[Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of criticality analysis]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the criticality analysis performed by organizations. Developer input is essential to organizational criticality analysis because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational systems that are designated as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial interest or potential adverse effects on the federal enterprise. Developer input is especially important when organizations conduct supply chain criticality analyses.

## SA-15(5) Attack Surface Reduction {#sa-15.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to reduce attack surfaces to <strong> <em>[Assignment: thresholds]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with threat and vulnerability analyses and system architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within systems, system components, and system services. Attack surface reduction includes implementing the concept of layered defenses, applying the principles of least privilege and least functionality, applying secure software development practices, deprecating unsafe functions, reducing entry points available to unauthorized users, reducing the amount of code that executes, and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to attacks.

</details>

## SA-15(6) Continuous Improvement {#sa-15.06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to implement an explicit process to continuously improve the development process.

Developer information may also be extremely helpful, such as when organizations respond to vulnerabilities in commercial off-the-shelf products.

</details>

## SA-15(11) Archive System or Component {#sa-15.11}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system or system component to archive the system or component to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence supporting the final security and privacy review.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Archiving system or system components requires the developer to retain key development artifacts, including hardware specifications, source code, object code, and relevant documentation from the development process that can provide a readily available configuration baseline for system and component upgrades or modifications.

</details>

## SA-15(12) Minimize Personally Identifiable Information {#sa-15.12}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system or system component to minimize the use of personally identifiable information in development and test environments.

<details>
