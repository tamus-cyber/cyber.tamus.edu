### Control

a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or

b. Provide the following options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): in-house support; <strong> <em>[Assignment: support from external providers]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong>.

  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.
