b. Accurately and completely describes the required security and privacy functionality, and the allocation of controls among physical and logical components; and

c. Expresses how individual security and privacy functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security and privacy capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

## SA-17(1) Formal Policy Model {#sa-17.01}

### Control

(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the _**[Assignment: organization-defined elements of organizational security and privacy policy]**_ to be enforced; and

(b) Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the organizational security and privacy policy when implemented.

## SA-17(3) Formal Correspondence {#sa-17.03}

### Control

(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;

(b) Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;

(c) Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

(d) Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

(e) Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.
