### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

Each state agency entering into or renewing a contract with a vendor authorized to access, transmit, use, or store data for the agency shall include a provision in the contract requiring the vendor to meet the security controls the agency determines are proportionate with the agency's risk under the contract based on the sensitivity of the agency's data. The vendor must periodically provide to the agency evidence that the vendor meets the security controls required under the contract.

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

a. Reviews and approves the security requirements in acquisition contracts of any new information system that processes and/or stores sensitive or high-impact information prior to the member procuring the system or service, and

b. Ensures acquisition contracts for information systems, system components, or information system services address information security, backup, and privacy requirements.

1. Such contracts should include right-to-audit and other provisions to provide appropriate assurance that applications and information are adequately protected.

2. Vendors and third parties adhere to all state and Federal laws and System policies pertaining to the protection of information resources and privacy of sensitive information.
