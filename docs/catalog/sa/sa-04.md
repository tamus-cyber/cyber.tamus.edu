### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

Each state agency entering into or renewing a contract with a vendor authorized to access, transmit, use, or store data for the agency shall include a provision in the contract requiring the vendor to meet the security controls the agency determines are proportionate with the agency's risk under the contract based on the sensitivity of the agency's data. The vendor must periodically provide to the agency evidence that the vendor meets the security controls required under the contract.

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

The member information security officer:

a. Reviews and approves the security requirements in acquisition contracts of any new information system that processes and/or stores sensitive or high-impact information prior to the member procuring the system or service, and

b. Ensures acquisition contracts for information systems, system components, or information system services address information security, backup, and privacy requirements.

1. Such contracts should include right-to-audit and other provisions to provide appropriate assurance that applications and information are adequately protected.

2. Vendors and third parties adhere to all state and Federal laws and System policies pertaining to the protection of information resources and privacy of sensitive information.

## SA-4(1) Functional Properties of Controls {#sa-04.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide a description of the functional properties of the controls to be implemented.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Functional properties of security and privacy controls describe the functionality (i.e., security or privacy capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the controls and specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls.

</details>

## SA-4(2) Design and Implementation Information for Controls {#sa-04.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide design and implementation information for the controls that includes: <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; <strong> <em>[Assignment: design and implementation information]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong> at <strong> <em>[Assignment: level of detail]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Organizations may require different levels of detail in the documentation for the design and implementation of controls in organizational systems, system components, or system services based on mission and business requirements, requirements for resiliency and trustworthiness, and requirements for analysis and testing. Systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of modules and the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Design and implementation documentation can include manufacturer, version, serial number, verification hash signature, software libraries used, date of purchase or download, and the vendor or download source. Source code and hardware schematics are referred to as the implementation representation of the system.

</details>

## SA-4(3) Development Methods, Techniques, and Practices {#sa-04.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes:

    (a)  <strong> <em>[Assignment: systems engineering methods]</em> </strong>;

    (b)  <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): <strong> <em>[Assignment: system security engineering methods]</em> </strong> ; <strong> <em>[Assignment: privacy engineering methods]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong> ; and

    (c)  <strong> <em>[Selection (one or more): <strong> <em>[Assignment: software development methods]</em> </strong> ; <strong> <em>[Assignment: testing, evaluation, assessment, verification, and validation methods]</em> </strong> ; <strong> <em>[Assignment: quality control processes]</em> </strong> ]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Following a system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems engineering methods, systems security and privacy engineering methods, and quality control processes helps to reduce the number and severity of latent errors within systems, system components, and system services. Reducing the number and severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services. Transparency in the methods and techniques that developers select and implement for systems engineering, systems security and privacy engineering, software development, component and system assessments, and quality control processes provides an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of the system, system component, or system service being acquired.

</details>

## SA-4(6) Use of Information Assurance Products {#sa-04.06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

    (a) Employ only government off-the-shelf or commercial off-the-shelf information assurance and information assurance-enabled information technology products that compose an NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit the information are at a lower classification level than the information being transmitted; and

    (b) Ensure that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by NSA or in accordance with NSA-approved procedures.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Commercial off-the-shelf IA or IA-enabled information technology products used to protect classified information by cryptographic means may be required to use NSA-approved key management. See <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#3d575737-98cb-459d-b41c-d7e82b73ad78">NSA CSFC</a>.

</details>

## SA-4(8) Continuous Monitoring Plan for Controls {#sa-04.08}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to produce a plan for continuous monitoring of control effectiveness that is consistent with the continuous monitoring program of the organization.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

The objective of continuous monitoring plans is to determine if the planned, required, and deployed controls within the system, system component, or system service continue to be effective over time based on the inevitable changes that occur. Developer continuous monitoring plans include a sufficient level of detail such that the information can be incorporated into continuous monitoring programs implemented by organizations. Continuous monitoring plans can include the types of control assessment and monitoring activities planned, frequency of control monitoring, and actions to be taken when controls fail or become ineffective.

</details>

## SA-4(9) Functions, Ports, Protocols, and Services in Use {#sa-04.09}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design stages) allows organizations to influence the design of the system, system component, or system service. This early involvement in the system development life cycle helps organizations avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or services or requiring system service providers to do so. Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting of controls after the system, component, or system service has been implemented. <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#sa-9">SA-9</a> describes the requirements for external system services. Organizations identify which functions, ports, protocols, and services are provided from external sources.

</details>

## SA-4(10) Use of Approved PIV Products {#sa-04.10}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes

### Control

Employ only information technology products on the FIPS 201-approved products list for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) capability implemented within organizational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>
