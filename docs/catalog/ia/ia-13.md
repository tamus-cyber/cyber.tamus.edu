# IA-13 Identity Providers and Authorization Servers {#ia-13}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control

Employ identity providers and authorization servers to manage user, device, and non-person entity (NPE) identities, attributes, and access rights supporting authentication and authorization decisions in accordance with <strong> <em>[Assignment: policy]</em> </strong> using <strong> <em>[Assignment: mechanisms]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Identity providers, both internal and external to the organization, manage the user, device, and NPE authenticators and issue statements, often called identity assertions, attesting to identities of other systems or systems components. Authorization servers create and issue access tokens to identified and authenticated users and devices that can be used to gain access to system or information resources. For example, single sign-on (SSO) provides identity provider and authorization server functions. Authenticator management (to include credential management) is covered by IA-05.

## IA-13(1) Protection of Cryptographic Keys {#ia-13.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control

Cryptographic keys that protect access tokens are generated, managed, and protected from disclosure and misuse.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Identity assertions and access tokens are typically digitally signed. The private keys used to sign these assertions and tokens are protected commensurate with the impact of the system and information resources that can be accessed. 

</details>

## IA-13(2) Verification of Identity Assertions and Access Tokens {#ia-13.02}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control

The source and integrity of identity assertions and access tokens are verified before granting access to system and information resources.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

This includes verification of digital signatures protecting identity assertions and access tokens, as well as included metadata. Metadata includes information about the access request such as information unique to user, system or information resource being accessed, or the transaction itself such as time. Protected system and information resources could include connected networks, applications, and APIs.

</details>

## IA-13(3) Token Management {#ia-13.03}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control

In accordance with <strong> <em>[Assignment: policy]</em> </strong>, assertions and access tokens are:

    (a) generated;

    (b) issued;

    (c) refreshed;

    (d) revoked;

    (e) time-restricted; and

    (f) audience-restricted.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

An access token is a piece of data that represents the authorization granted to a user or NPE to access specific systems or information resources. Access tokens enable controlled access to services and resources. Properly managing the lifecycle of access tokens, including their issuance, validation, and revocation, is crucial to maintaining confidentiality of data and systems. Restricting token validity to a specific audience, e.g., an application or security domain, and restricting token validity lifetimes are important practices. Access tokens are revoked or invalidated if they are compromised, lost, or are no longer needed to mitigate the risks associated with stolen or misused tokens.
