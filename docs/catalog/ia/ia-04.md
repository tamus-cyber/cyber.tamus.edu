# IA-4 Identifier Management {#ia-04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

Manage system identifiers by:

a. Receiving authorization from <strong title="ia-04_odp.01"> <em>[Assignment: personnel or roles]</em> </strong> to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier;

b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device;

c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device; and

d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for <strong title="ia-04_odp.02"> <em>[Assignment: time period]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ac-2">AC-2</a> use account names provided by <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ia-4">IA-4</a> . Identifier management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Moved to [PS-4](../../ps/ps-04/#ps-04), [PS-5](../../ps/ps-05/#ps-05).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## IA-4(1) Prohibit Account Identifiers as Public Identifiers {#ia-04.01}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Prohibit the use of system account identifiers that are the same as public identifiers for individual accounts.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Prohibiting account identifiers as public identifiers applies to any publicly disclosed account identifier used for communication such as, electronic mail and instant messaging. Prohibiting the use of systems account identifiers that are the same as some public identifier, such as the individual identifier section of an electronic mail address, makes it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers. Prohibiting account identifiers as public identifiers without the implementation of other supporting controls only complicates guessing of identifiers. Additional protections are required for authenticators and credentials to protect the account.

## IA-4(2) Supervisor Authorization {#ia-04.02}


<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [IA-12(1)](../../ia/ia-12/#ia-12.01).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## IA-4(3) Multiple Forms of Certification {#ia-04.03}


<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [IA-12(2)](../../ia/ia-12/#ia-12.02).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## IA-4(4) Identify User Status {#ia-04.04}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as <strong title="ia-04.04_odp"> <em>[Assignment: characteristics]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Characteristics that identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign nationals, and non-organizational users. Identifying the status of individuals by these characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor.

</details>

## IA-4(5) Dynamic Management {#ia-04.05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Information System

### Control

Manage individual identifiers dynamically in accordance with <strong title="ia-04.05_odp"> <em>[Assignment: dynamic identifier policy]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

In contrast to conventional approaches to identification that presume static accounts for preregistered users, many distributed systems establish identifiers at runtime for entities that were previously unknown. When identifiers are established at runtime for previously unknown entities, organizations can anticipate and provision for the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate credentials and related identifiers are essential.

</details>

## IA-4(6) Cross-organization Management {#ia-04.06}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Coordinate with the following external organizations for cross-organization management of identifiers: <strong title="ia-04.06_odp"> <em>[Assignment: external organizations]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Cross-organization identifier management provides the capability to identify individuals, groups, roles, or devices when conducting cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of information.

</details>

## IA-4(7) In-person Registration {#ia-04.07}


<prop xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" name="status" value="withdrawn">
               <em>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [IA-12(4)](../../ia/ia-12/#ia-12.04).]</em>
            </prop>
            

## IA-4(8) Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifiers {#ia-04.08}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Generate pairwise pseudonymous identifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

A pairwise pseudonymous identifier is an opaque unguessable subscriber identifier generated by an identity provider for use at a specific individual relying party. Generating distinct pairwise pseudonymous identifiers with no identifying information about a subscriber discourages subscriber activity tracking and profiling beyond the operational requirements established by an organization. The pairwise pseudonymous identifiers are unique to each relying party except in situations where relying parties can show a demonstrable relationship justifying an operational need for correlation, or all parties consent to being correlated in such a manner.

</details>

## IA-4(9) Attribute Maintenance and Protection {#ia-04.09}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization; Information System

### Control

Maintain the attributes for each uniquely identified individual, device, or service in <strong title="ia-04.09_odp"> <em>[Assignment: protected central storage]</em> </strong>.

<details>
  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

For each of the entities covered in <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ia-2">IA-2</a>, <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ia-3">IA-3</a>, <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ia-8">IA-8</a> , and <a xmlns="http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0" href="#ia-9">IA-9</a> , it is important to maintain the attributes for each authenticated entity on an ongoing basis in a central (protected) store.
