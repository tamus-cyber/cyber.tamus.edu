b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization;

c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;

d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;

e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;

f. Changing or refreshing authenticators _**[Assignment: time period by authenticator type]**_ or when _**[Assignment: events]**_ occur;

g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;

h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific controls to protect authenticators; and

i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
