# RA-9 Criticality Analysis {#ra-09}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization

### Control

Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality analysis for <strong> <em>[Assignment: systems, system components, or system services]</em> </strong> at <strong> <em>[Assignment: decision points in the system development life cycle]</em> </strong>.

  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant protections. For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and external to the system.
