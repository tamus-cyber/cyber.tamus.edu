# RA-5 Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning {#ra-05}

_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\
_**Contributes to Assurance**_: Yes\
_**Texas DIR Baseline**_: LOW\
_**Texas DIR Required By**_: 2023-07-20

### Control

a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications _**[Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process]**_ and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported;

b. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:

1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

3. Measuring vulnerability impact;

c. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring;

d. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities _**[Assignment: response times]**_ in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk;

e. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with _**[Assignment: personnel or roles]**_ to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems; and

f. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.
