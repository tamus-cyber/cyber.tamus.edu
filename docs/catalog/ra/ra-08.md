_**Implementation Level**_: Organization\

### Control

Conduct privacy impact assessments for systems, programs, or other activities before:

a. Developing or procuring information technology that processes personally identifiable information; and

b. Initiating a new collection of personally identifiable information that:

1. Will be processed using information technology; and

2.

  <summary>Supplemental Guidance</summary>

A privacy impact assessment is an analysis of how personally identifiable information is handled to ensure that handling conforms to applicable privacy requirements, determine the privacy risks associated with an information system or activity, and evaluate ways to mitigate privacy risks. A privacy impact assessment is both an analysis and a formal document that details the process and the outcome of the analysis.
