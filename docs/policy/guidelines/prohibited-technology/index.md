## Background

On December 7, 2022, Governor Greg Abbott [issued a directive](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-orders-aggressive-action-against-tiktok)[^1] requiring all state agencies to ban the video-sharing application TikTok from all state-owned and state-issued devices and networks over the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to use the application for surveilling Texans.  Governor Abbott also directed the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) and the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) to develop a plan providing state agencies guidance on managing personal devices used to conduct state business.  Following the issuance of the Governor’s directive, the 88th Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 1893[^2], which prohibits the use of covered applications on governmental entity devices.

This regulation applies to the system and its members, including their employees, contractors, interns, and any users of member-owned networks.
