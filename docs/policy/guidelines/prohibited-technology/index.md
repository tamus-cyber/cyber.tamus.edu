:::note[These guidelines are effective October 7, 2024.]

:::

## Background

On December 7, 2022, Governor Greg Abbott issued a directive requiring all state agencies to ban the video-sharing application TikTok from all state-owned and state-issued devices and networks over the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to use the application for surveilling Texans.  Governor Abbott also directed the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) and the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) to develop a plan providing state agencies guidance on managing personal devices used to conduct state business.  Following the issuance of the Governor’s directive, the 88th Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 1893[^1], which prohibits the use of covered applications on governmental entity devices.

## Guidance Statement

The guidance issued by DPS and DIR requires The Texas A&M University System (**“system”**) to remove covered applications and prohibited technology which are on the DIR prohibited technology list[^2] (**“Prohibited Technology”**) from state-owned and state-issued devices and block access to prohibited technology from state-owned networks.  

**Covered applications** are defined as (1) the social media service TikTok or any successor application or service developed or provided by ByteDance Limited, or an entity owned by ByteDance Limited, and (2) social media applications or services specified by proclamation of the governor under Tex. Gov’t Code § 620.005[^3]. **Prohibited technology** is any other hardware or software prohibited by DIR from use on state-owned and state-issued devices.

This plan is adopted under the authority of System Policy 29.01, _Information Resources_[^4], and applies to all system employees, contractors, and users of system member networks.  All system employees, contractors, and users are responsible for complying with this plan.  In this plan, **“prohibit”** is to not allow by policy and **“prevent”** is to have a technical control in place unless an exception exists.

## Exceptions

All exceptions to this plan are treated as high residual risk decisions as defined in 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 202.75(4)(B)[^5] and must be approved by the institution of higher education head and reported to DIR using established member procedures for processing exceptions.  This authority may not be delegated.  

Exceptions to **covered applications** are limited to the following categories:

* Law enforcement and public safety investigations
* Developing or implementing information security measures

Exceptions to **other prohibited technology** are limited to the following categories:

* Law enforcement and public safety investigations
* Other investigations and adjudications required by law, regulation or policy
* Enforcement of system-owned intellectual property rights
* Research in which a Prohibited Technology is critical to the project and an approved technology control plan is in place to protect campus research security, data and networks

## Member Implementation

Members are directed to implement any necessary administrative, operational or technical security controls to accomplish the following:

**1. MANAGING MEMBER-OWNED DEVICES AND NETWORKS**

1.5. Members must prohibit personal devices with prohibited hardware technology from connecting to member technology infrastructure, specifically local networks and VPN connections.  Connections to public-facing member technology through the Internet (such as the member’s public website or publicly available applications) are excluded from this prohibition.
