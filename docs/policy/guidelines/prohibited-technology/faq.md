## General Questions

<details>
	<summary>What’s the difference between a Covered Application and a Prohibited Technology?</summary>

	**Covered applications** are limited to certain social media applications and services, such as TikTok. The prohibition against covered applications extends only to institution-owned devices, and exceptions are extremely limited to law enforcement and information security purposes.

	**Prohibited technologies** are a broad set of hardware and software products and services specified by the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR). The prohibition has a broad set of technical and administrative requirements that apply to both institution-owned devices and personally-owned devices used for state business.

	<summary>Can I request an exception to access a technology prohibited by the Governor’s directive?</summary>

	Faculty and staff may request exceptions for Prohibited Technologies. To request an exception, follow your institution's exception request process. The form must include a business justification and be approved by the institution head (university president or agency director).

	No exceptions may be authorized for social media services classified as Covered Applications under Tex. Gov't Code Chapter 620.

<details>
	<summary>What technologies are prohibited?</summary>

	DIR maintains a list of Prohibited Technologies, including software, applications, developers, hardware, equipment, and manufacturers, as well as technologies from any subsidiary or affiliate of an entity on DIR’s list (e.g., a software studio or child company partially owned by a listed entity). 

	The list is available here: https://dir.texas.gov/information-security/prohibited-technologies

	Covered Applications are identified by proclamation of the Governor. Presently the only technologies identified as Covered Applications are TikTok and other services from TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd.

<details>
	<summary>Can I access TikTok (or other prohibited software) on Texas A&M University System property as long as I’m using a personal device and my own data?</summary>

	The Texas A&M System does not manage user personal devices. Users with personal devices with prohibited technologies installed will be prohibited from entering sensitive locations and may be blocked on A&M System member networks if they connect to those networks.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Why does the Texas A&M System have to comply with the Governor’s Directive on Prohibited technologies?</summary>

	The Texas A&M System and its members are public institutions of higher education and state agencies, and are therefore subject to complying with requirements set by the Office of the Governor, rules set by regulatory agencies, and legislative mandates passed into law. Further, the A&M System issues policies corresponding to similar compliance requirements.
