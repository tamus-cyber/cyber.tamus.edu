	<p>Texas A&M System Cybersecurity provides monitoring, detection, and response as a service (MDRaaS) to help customers optimize their cyber defense posture. These services monitor customer devices and networks for signs of malicious or anomalous activity, eliminate false positives, and escalate only actionable items as an alert. MDRaaS alleviates alert and log fatigue by filtering out all of the false positives and only “alerts” on what is impactful. The elimination of false positives saves customers time and effort in reviewing potential threats.</p>
