<p>Some of our Sites engage in online interest-based advertising to enhance your experience and show you advertisements that might interest you. Like many organizations, we and our advertising partners display tailored interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our Sites. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as searching on our Sites or visiting websites that contain our content or ads. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers.</p>
<p>To learn more about interest-based ads or to opt-out of receiving third-party interest-based ads, please visit <a href="https://youradchoices.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youradchoices.com</a> or <a href="https://youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Please note that if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you will still see advertisements – they will just not be tailored to your interests. Also note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.</p>
